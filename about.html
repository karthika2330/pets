        <h2><p>A pet is more than just an animal — they are a loyal friend, a source of joy, and a part of the family. Our Love at First Sight Snuggle Center, started in 2021, has been home to many animals waiting for love. We have welcomed and cared for dogs, cats, birds, and more — and many people have adopted pets from our center, giving them a second chance at life. Every pet here is kept in good health with proper food, medical care, and affection. “Love at First Sight Snuggle” means loving and caring for them from the moment they enter your home until their last breath. In return, they gift you unconditional love, endless happiness, and memories that last forever. To them, you are their whole world — so be their world for life.</p></h2>        </center>
